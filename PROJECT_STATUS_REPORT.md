## ⚠️ **COMPONENTS NEEDING ATTENTION**

### 🚨 **Critical Issues**

#### 1. **Name Consistency Validation**
- **Issue:** Teacher/staff names in absence reporting must exactly match master schedule
- **Impact:** High - Could cause data integrity issues
- **Solution:** Implement dropdown selection from database instead of free text input
- **Status:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX

#### 2. **Coverage Assignment UI**
- **Issue:** Absent teacher list must match those with absence records
- **Impact:** High - Could show incorrect assignment options
- **Solution:** Filter assignment page to only show teachers with current absences
- **Status:** 🔴 NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX

### 🟡 **Medium Priority Issues**

#### 3. **Database Migration to Production**
- **Issue:** Currently using SQLite, needs PostgreSQL for production
- **Impact:** Medium - Affects scalability and deployment
- **Solution:** Update DATABASE_URL and run migrations
- **Status:** 🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION

#### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- **Issue:** Development environment variables need production equivalents
- **Impact:** Medium - Required for deployment
- **Solution:** Create production .env file with proper secrets
- **Status:** 🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION

### 🟢 **Low Priority Enhancements**

#### 5. **Advanced Features**
- **Issue:** Year-long coverage tracking not fully implemented
- **Impact:** Low - Core functionality works without this
- **Solution:** Add historical data views and analytics
- **Status:** 🟢 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

#### 6. **Performance Optimization**
- **Issue:** Large dataset handling could be optimized
- **Impact:** Low - Current performance is acceptable
- **Solution:** Add pagination and caching
- **Status:** 🟢 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
